> This is a little project limited only to the development of only one complex feature. This was my first step into Angular framework. I intended this as a challenge of 48h. At first, I did some courses in about 48h then developed this application in less than other 48h. I really liked Angular so much because of its closed file structure rules. I think it makes this technology quite scalable!

### Full fill mode
  <p>
      <span style="font-weight: bolder;">IMPORTANT!!</span> Activating "fill full width" toggle AFTER editing column size will not work. This is because it's been designed to be activated or deactivated by default. The toggle button is a developer tool. If you want to activate this mode but you have edited some column size, refresh the page first. 
  </p>

  <li>
        Activate the toggle button to make let the table be full-filled.
  </li>

  <li>
      Due to aesthetics reasons, if there are too few columns, the table will not get fully filed. 
  </li>
